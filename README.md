# Unsupervised Brain Tumor Segmentation Via Inversely Latent Space Optimization

## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for our research on "Unsupervised Brain Tumor Segmentation Via Inversely Latent Space Optimization." Our work introduces a novel approach to segmenting brain tumors in MRI images using unsupervised learning methodologies, specifically leveraging the capabilities of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and inverse latent space optimization.
The project adapts and extends techniques from recent advancements in image inpainting using GANs, applying them to the medical imaging domain, particularly for MRI scans of brain tumors. By inversely optimizing the latent space within the GAN architecture, our method autonomously learns to identify and segment brain tumors, reducing the dependence on extensive labeled datasets.
